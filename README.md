This modpack contains around 110 mods (mostly improvements to the game) that have the goal of just changing things around adding some useful things and not be a really complicated modpack.
Also this is a good starter modpack with not too many things all around the place that has a just the amount of mods to feel confortable.
You will encounter biomes, fancy trees, seasons, thirst, temperature and magic (for the exception of one technological mod: thermal, mostly for its item/fluid pipes).
The modpack has been tweaked around for the best experience as possible, it some craft changes in order to simplify decoration and make high level stuff harder.

Here are the main goals of this modpack:
- Understanding which mods does what, and how to use JEI efficiently
- Make better storage and furnaces using iron chest, drawers and iron furnaces
- Make tinker construct tools / armor
- Understanding FTB Utilities chunk claiming for teams
- Enjoying build cool things with the provided decoration mods (biomes o' plenty, chisel, crayfish & macaw furniture mods)
- Traveling around using waystones
- Getting started with botania and its magic uses
- Understanding how astral can be really useful but long
- Growing up resources using Mystical Agriculture to be even more lazy mining!
- Getting slowly started in the energy system with Thermal Foundation (no other tech mods are provided, and should be tweaked to force players to use previous stuff)

Quests will be added soon if i continue this modpack or you want me to continue it, and will also probably receive custom mods in order to complete it
